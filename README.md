# Y-Combinator-application-and-interviews-guide
A living breathing document for Y Combinator applications and interviews
Hi everyone,

I'm creating this document as a collection of resources that prospective Y Combinator applicants can use to learn more about applying and interviewing for the program.

We were fortunate to learn from a lot of information shared by other founders and Y Combinator itself. This information is scattered across blogs, videos, and other websites.

So, we decided to make an open source repository for people to go through all the helpful resources in one place. This will save a lot of time for founders/applicants.

Please help us make it better and keep it up to date by sending new links that we missed.


This repository will be constantly updated with new information.

Hope it helps!
